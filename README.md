# Instagram-clone
Whole new Instagram web-app with features from Facebook, Twitter &amp; Google+. Believe it's much better than their Instagram!!!

# Making it your own
1. There's a SQL file named "instagram.sql" it contains all details database details.
2. Import the same SQL file in PHPMyAdmin and it will create the Instagram database.
3. Replace the username, password and host of PDO connection with yours by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+F (in Atom and VS Code for searching the whole project) or else App won't work.
4. The root of this project is /faiyaz/Instagram/ and in your case the root will be different for eg. http://www.yoursite.com/. "/faiyaz/Instagram/" to "yourroot/". Don't forget to add backslash at the end. Replace easily by CTRL+SHIFT+F.
